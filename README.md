College Interactive Map 
============================================
<p align="justify">

This project aims at building a website for the new students and visitors of our college **(DSCE)** for their ease in understanding the college campus map and design (locations of all departments). It also includes relevant links of the college website to the buildings on the map to make it interactive. This way students can not only view the entire campus on their finger tips but also access some important lnks of the department they wish to know about.
